**SmartBrain Final Project**

A facial recognition app built with react, node, express, postgreSQL which utilises the clarifai API to detect a face in an image which is uploaded via URL. Includes sign in & registration page which is connected to back end database. Server built in node/express dealing with requests from the front end. Deployed via Heroku.

Note: Unforunately due to breaking changes in some of the isntalled packages, the particles and tilt functions of the page have been removed.
